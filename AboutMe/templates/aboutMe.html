                    I'm a chess player, a programmer and a gamer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Verona, Italy, and I've been living there for 21 years. If you're wondering my name is Persian as my mother is from Iran and my father is Italian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided to study CS because I'm fascinated by AI. As a kid I've often dwelled upon machines 
                    that can think and interact with humans, and I've always been interested in the idea of creating 
                    something that can think and act on its own. So I decided to enroll in the University of Trento and begin 
                    my journey.
